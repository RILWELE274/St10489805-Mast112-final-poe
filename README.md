Chef’s Menu App — Final Portfolio of Evidence (PoE)
Overview
This document represents the Final Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) submission for the Application Development module.
The project demonstrates mastery of TypeScript programming, React Native development, and code organization best practices, following all rubric requirements and lecturer feedback from Part 2.
The Chef’s Menu App allows a chef to manage menu items and a guest to browse and filter them by course.
It uses loops, functions, and global variables to process and organize data efficiently.
All requested features and learning outcomes are now complete and fully functional.

 Learning Outcomes Demonstrated
1.	 Use of for loops to solve programming problems.
2.	Use of while loops for validation and control flow.
3.	 Use of for...in loops for object and array traversal.
4.	Ability to define and call functions to organize code.
5.	 Use of global variables (via React Context API).
6.	Refactoring and code organization across multiple files.

 Feedback from Part 2 and Improvements
Feedback from Lecturer	Action Taken	Result
“Feature implemented with some bugs.”	Fixed data duplication and improved state management when adding/removing items.	Add and remove now work perfectly.
“Feature not implemented or buggy.”	Added full Filter by Course page.	Guests can now filter by Starters, Mains, Desserts, etc.
“Some mistakes in design.”	Improved color contrast, consistent spacing, and better font sizes.	Clean and user-friendly interface.
“Improve code organization.”	Split components into separate files and created helper functions.	Clean, modular project structure.
“Add changelog and comments.”	Created this README with detailed changelog and comments throughout code.	Improved documentation.
“Improve demonstration.”	Added full video voice-over demo showing all features.	Clear, engaging presentation.
All feedback from Part 2 was applied, improving performance, visuals, and user experience.

 Final Features Implemented
1. Home Screen — Average Price per Course
Displays the average price of all menu items grouped by course.
Uses a for loop to calculate averages dynamically.
Updates automatically when new items are added or removed.
Rubric Reference: App feature “Display average price per course” (10 Marks)

2. Separate Add Item Screen (Chef’s Screen)
•	New screen for chefs to add and remove menu items.
•	Uses form input with Picker for course selection.
•	Validates entries using a while loop.
•	Saved globally using Context API.
Rubric Reference: App feature “Separate screen for adding menu items” (20 Marks)

3. Menu Items Saved in a Global Array
All items are stored in a global array using React Context.
Data is shared across all screens without reloading.
Chef can remove any item, and the Home screen updates instantly.
Rubric Reference: App feature “Menu items saved in array and removable” (20 Marks)

4. Guest Filter Screen
Guests can filter menu items by course type (Starters, Mains, Desserts, etc.).
Implemented using a for...in loop and filter function.
Displays only matching items with updated counts.
Rubric Reference: App feature “Guest filter by course” (20 Marks)

5. Refactored Code and Structure
All logic and UI have been separated into clear files:
src/
 ├── components/
 │    └── MenuItemCard.tsx
 ├── context/
 │    └── MenuContext.tsx
 ├── screens/
 │    ├── HomeScreen.tsx
 │    ├── AddItemScreen.tsx
 │    └── FilterScreen.tsx
 └── App.tsx
•	Added functions for repetitive logic.
•	Added comments for clarity.
•	Removed redundant code.
Rubric Reference: “Code organization and modularity” (5 Marks)
6. Improved User Interface
•	Consistent layout, colors, and typography.
•	Responsive design for mobile devices.
•	Clean and intuitive navigation.
•	Buttons clearly labeled and visually appealing.
Rubric Reference: “User interface design and consistency” (10 Marks)

Loops and Functions Demonstrated
Type	Example	Purpose
for loop	Calculating average prices	Grouped data summary
while loop	Validating input before adding items	Prevent invalid entries
for...in loop	Filtering menu items by course	Dynamic data filtering
Functions	addMenuItem(), removeMenuItem(), calculateAverage()	Modular logic
Global Variables	Context API for shared menu data	Persistent app-wide state
Rubric Reference: “Use of loops, functions, and variables” (15 Marks)

 Change Log
#	Change Description	Type	Files Affected
1	Fixed duplicate menu item bug	Bug Fix	AddItemScreen.tsx
2	Created new Add Item screen	Feature	AddItemScreen.tsx, App.tsx
3	Added average price display	Feature	HomeScreen.tsx
4	Added guest filter functionality	Feature	FilterScreen.tsx
5	Implemented remove item button	Enhancement	AddItemScreen.tsx
6	Improved UI (color, alignment, spacing)	UI Update	All screens
7	Introduced global context for data	Refactor	MenuContext.tsx
8	Added comments and optimized loops	Code Quality	All files
9	Completed README with changelog	Documentation	README.md
